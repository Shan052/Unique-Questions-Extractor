# Unique-Questions-Extractor
Duplicate Question Detector built using a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model to identify semantically similar questions. The system extracts questions from PDF files, generates sentence embeddings, and applies cosine similarity for accurate duplicate detection. Deployed with an interactive Streamlit web interface.
